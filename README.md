# Docker 101 - Getting started with containers

Introduction guide to getting started with Docker containers


## Prerequsites

To do this lab you'll need a system with Docker installed, if you don't already have it installed follow the link below which will take you through installing docker for your platform

https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

When docker is sucessfully installed you should be able to run the ```docker --version``` command to verify that the docker daemon is running.

> docker --version

Alternatively, use an in-browser Docker playground called play-with-docker.com. The play-with-docker.com site provides access to a full VM running Docker directly in a web browser, making it easy to work with Docker from any device.

To use this open play-with-docker.com on a browser the site displays a Captcha dialog to ensure that you're not a robot. Press Play and complete the Captcha to continue to play-with-docker.com. The play-with-docker site displays a session countdown and an Add New Instance button.
Click the Add New Instance button. The play-with-docker.com site creates and displays a terminal session in the browser. The rest of this learning lab uses the in-browser terminal session to work with Docker.
